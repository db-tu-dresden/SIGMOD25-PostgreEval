# Datasets

This directory contains the raw result data that was used to generate the plots and summary statistics of the paper.
Or rather, since that would be quite a lot of data (> 3GB to be precise), this folder hosts a loader utility `load-dataset.sh`.
This loader takes care of fetching the requested data sets from the [OPARA open access repository](https://opara.zih.tu-dresden.de/items/caf1add1-a309-4956-8291-9f3d9cb932dc).
Use `--help` on the loader to view all available datasets.
In short, each data set correponds to one section of the paper.
Individual READMEs describe the structure of the data further.
